# 06 — Audit log schema

> Pin the BYO-RDBMS audit-log shape: the core 9 columns, per-

>
> Promotes ADR-0006 §5 draft to canonical and resolves TBD-3, TBD-4,
> TBD-5 from 0003 § 3.3.8.
>
> **Kanban Protocol layering (per ADR-0025).** Audit log emission
> is a **board-superpowers plugin invariant**, NOT a Kanban Protocol
> postcondition or compliance requirement. Every mutating skill
> writes audit rows regardless of which backend projection is
> active; the schema below applies cross-backend. The `project`
> column's content is backend-shaped (see column note); column
> name / width / required-ness are protocol-stable. Per
> [`00-kanban-protocol.md`](./00-kanban-protocol.md) "the Kanban
> Protocol is NOT a test contract / compliance gate" — audit log is

## Core schema — 9 columns

The AuditEntry value object. Append-only; immutable once written;
no UPDATE / DELETE supported in the contract.

| Column | Type (Postgres) | Type (MySQL equiv) | Required? | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------|-------|
| `timestamp` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `DATETIME(3)` | yes | Wall-clock time the entry was written. Always UTC. |
| `project` | `TEXT` | `VARCHAR(255)` | yes | Backend-shaped opaque project identifier — for the v1 GitHubProjectAdapter projection it is the `OWNER/NUMBER` GitHub Project string (round-trip stable per ADR-0005's projection). Future backends write whatever their `project_ref` shape is per the active `kanban.backend` (see [`03-config-schemas.md`](./03-config-schemas.md) `kanban:` block). The column name and width are protocol-stable; the field's content is projection-specific. |
| `session_id` | `TEXT` | `VARCHAR(64)` | yes | The originating CC or Codex session id (UUID-shaped at v1). |
| `actor_role` | `TEXT` (CHECK in `('producer','consumer')`) | `ENUM('producer','consumer')` | yes | Lowercase per §1.4 cross-cutting note + 0003 § 3.3.8. |
| `actor_seat` | `TEXT` nullable | `VARCHAR(16)` nullable | no | `analyst`, `architect`, `rd`, `qa`, `em`, or `human`; NULL for pre-seat and unbound legacy rows. Independent of execution shape. |
| `action_id` | `SMALLINT` | `SMALLINT` | yes | Matrix row id; see "action_id catalog" below. |
| `payload` | `JSONB` | `JSON` | yes | Per-`action_id` shape; see "Per-`action_id` payload sub-schemas" below. |
| `outcome` | `TEXT` (CHECK in `('success','failure')`) | `ENUM('success','failure')` | yes | **Execution-layer** terminal state — did the action's effect land cleanly. See "outcome enum" below. |
| `approval_stage` | `TEXT` (CHECK in `('auto','propose','approved','rejected')`) | `ENUM('auto','propose','approved','rejected')` | yes | **Process-layer** position in the approval lifecycle — orthogonal to `outcome`. See "approval_stage enum" below. |

### Indices (recommended)

The plugin DOES NOT manage indices on the architect's database
(per P7 — mechanism, not configuration). The DDL init script
creates a primary surrogate key + the CHECK constraints; index
choices are the architect's. Suggested starter:

```sql
CREATE INDEX audit_project_timestamp_idx ON audit_log(project, timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX audit_session_idx           ON audit_log(session_id);
CREATE INDEX audit_action_id_idx         ON audit_log(action_id);
CREATE INDEX audit_approval_stage_idx    ON audit_log(approval_stage);
```

### Cited rationale

- ADR-0006 §5 (audit-entry schema draft, finalized here).
- 0003 § 3.3.8 AuditTrail aggregate (canonical entity home).
- I-8 (audit-log uniformity — Producer + Consumer entries share
  one schema).

---

## `outcome` enum (execution layer)

`outcome` records what happened when the action's effect was
applied. It is the answer to "did the side effect land".

| Value | When to write |
|-------|---------------|
| `success` | The action's side effect (state mutation, GitHub call, file write) executed cleanly |
| `failure` | The action attempted but failed (transport / permission / schema_mismatch / hard-floor block) |

`outcome` is required on every entry. R-class proposal entries
(`approval_stage = 'propose'`) carry `outcome = success` if the
proposal was successfully drafted and presented to the architect,
or `outcome = failure` if proposal drafting itself failed.

## `approval_stage` enum (process layer)

`approval_stage` records where the action sits in the approval
lifecycle. It is the answer to "what was the governance path".

| Value | When to write |
|-------|---------------|
| `auto` | A-class action — executed without architect approval (per ADR-0006 D-AUTONOMY-1) |
| `propose` | R-class action's first entry — Producer drafted the proposal and is awaiting architect response |
| `approved` | R-class action's second entry — architect approved AND the action then executed (with `outcome` reporting the execution result) |
| `rejected` | R-class action's second entry — architect declined the proposal (`outcome = success` since "successfully recorded the rejection") |

### Two-entry rule for R-class actions

Per ADR-0006 §1: every R-class action writes **two** AuditEntry
rows.

- **Entry 1 (propose):** `approval_stage = 'propose'`,
  `outcome = success` (proposal drafted and presented).
  `payload` carries the proposal text + the action's would-be
  parameters.
- **Entry 2 (resolve):** `approval_stage ∈ {'approved', 'rejected'}`
  depending on architect response. If `approved`, `outcome ∈
  {success, failure}` reflects whether the post-approval execution
  succeeded. If `rejected`, `outcome = success`.

The two entries share `session_id` + `action_id` + `project`;
they're linked via timestamp ordering (entry 2 always has a later
timestamp than entry 1).

### A-class single-entry rule

A-class actions write **one** AuditEntry row with
`approval_stage = 'auto'` and `outcome ∈ {success, failure}`.

### Why two enums instead of one

Earlier draft (pre-2026-04-26) had a single `outcome` column
with values `{success, failure, escalated, rejected}`, which
conflated the execution-layer question ("did it work") with the
process-layer question ("what stage of approval"). The split
makes the dominant queries crisp:

- "Last week's failed actions": `WHERE outcome = 'failure'`
- "Last week's rejected proposals": `WHERE approval_stage = 'rejected'`
- "All A-class executions on Project X this month":
  `WHERE approval_stage = 'auto' AND project = 'X' AND timestamp > '...'`

## `action_id` catalog

`action_id` is a stable integer reference into a documented
matrix. The catalog has four stable blocks:

- **Producer rows: 1–14** — from ADR-0006 §3 (canonical).
- **Consumer rows: 100–113** — finalized here per TBD-3 (canonical
  numbering proposal in this file). Rows 105–111 split the prior
  single "review-cycle response" row into seven sub-action rows so
  retro queries can filter by sub-action at the column level
  rather than via JSONB path extraction. Rows 112–113 cover the
  Consumer's PR-submit pre-flight card body sync and the
  post-merge cleanup terminal action.
- **Bootstrap rows: 200–208** — the 9 mutating actions of the
  `bootstrapping-repo` skill (host manifest write + 8 per-repo
  sub-steps in execution order). All A-class by default; the
  read-only Status-field validation sub-step (2b) does not get
  an `action_id` because it does not mutate state.

Producer-vantage rows that apply symmetrically to Consumer-side
actions (per §1.4 cross-cutting note — rows 8 / 12 / 13) keep their
Producer numbers and are written with `actor_role = consumer`. A
sibling Consumer row in the 100-range exists ONLY where the action
has no Producer counterpart (claim, surface, terminate, etc.).

### Producer rows — 1–14 (per ADR-0006 §3)

| `action_id` | Action | Default class |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Create cards (decomposition output) | A |
| 2 | Edit card body (refine description, add acceptance criteria) | A |
| 3 | Split card | R |
| 4 | Update `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` | R |
| 5 | Backlog → Ready transition | A |
| 6 | In Progress → Blocked transition | R |
| 7 | Close stale card | R |
| 8 | Cancel claim | R |
| 9 | Adjust WIP limit | A |
| 10 | Modify `.board-superpowers/config.yml` | R |
| 11 | Extend GitHub Project fields (add label / add status option) | A |
| 12 | Auto-merge PR | R (and N for Consumer per I-2) |
| 13 | Dispatch Consumer session | A |
| 14 | Auto-trigger retro / weekly report (cadence-driven) | A |

### Consumer rows — 100–113 (canonical, finalized per TBD-3)

| `action_id` | Action | Default class | Symmetric Producer row? |
|-------------|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| 100 | Claim card (atomic git-push) | A | none (claim is a Consumer-only primitive; § 1.4.1 F-C1) |
| 101 | Surface (F-C8 — propose-and-suspend) | R | partial mirror of row 4 / 8 in spirit; gets its own number because the action shape is Consumer-specific |
| 102 | Terminate — success path | A | none (success is a Consumer terminal action) |
| 103 | Terminate — failure path (Blocked + release claim + keep worktree) | R | partial mirror of row 6 (In Progress → Blocked); kept as a Consumer row because the side effects (claim release, worktree preservation) are Consumer-specific |
| 104 | Retro Notes write (initial at PR-submit + post-merge supplement) | A | none |
| 105 | Review-cycle response — direct one-line fix (apply architect's literal suggestion) | A | none (Consumer-only; § 1.4.1 F-C13) |
| 106 | Review-cycle response — re-delegation (hand back to `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` for substantive change) | A | none |
| 107 | Review-cycle response — verification chain (`superpowers:verification-before-completion` + `superpowers:requesting-code-review`) | A | none |
| 108 | Review-cycle response — cross-platform review (`gstack:/codex` adversarial pass) | A | none |
| 109 | Review-cycle response — QA pass (`gstack:/qa` browser-real verification) | A | none |
| 110 | Review-cycle response — security audit (`gstack:/cso` OWASP / STRIDE pass) | A | none |
| 111 | Review-cycle response — cycle completion (final commit + reply summarizing what landed across rows 105–110 in this cycle) | A | none |
| 112 | PR-submit pre-flight — card body sync (toggle ACs to `[x]`, write implementation summary) | A | none |
| 113 | Post-merge cleanup — remove worktree + delete local claim branch + write close audit row | A | none |

#### Numbering rationale

- 100-range chosen to avoid collision with future Producer rows
  (matrix-numbering reserves 1–99 for Producer expansion).
- Six rows is the minimum to cover the lifecycle moments listed
  in §1.4 (claim, surface, success-terminate, failure-terminate,
  retro write, review-cycle). Smaller sub-actions (F-C2 fetch,
  F-C3 worktree-entry, F-C7 hard-floor block) are folded into
  the surrounding row's payload (e.g., F-C3 transition emits
  a Producer row 13 entry with `actor_role = consumer` because
  it's a status transition, not a Consumer-specific action).
- F-C9 / F-C10 / F-C11 verification-chain invocations do NOT each
  get their own `action_id` — they emit one AuditEntry per
  invocation under `action_id = 105` with a `subaction` field in
  the payload distinguishing them. Rationale: the verification
  chain is one logical Consumer action ("run pre-submit checks");
  the per-skill outcomes are payload detail.

#### Consumer rows that REUSE Producer row numbers

- `actor_role = consumer` + `action_id = 5` — Consumer transitions
  Ready → In Progress at F-C3 (re-uses row 5 because the action
  semantics are identical to Producer's Backlog → Ready
  transition). Per §1.4.1 F-C3 + 0003 § 3.3.3.
- `actor_role = consumer` + `action_id = 13` — Mode-2 wake-up of a
  suspended Consumer (re-uses row 13 because dispatch is
  dispatch). Per §1.4 cross-cutting note "rows 8/12/13 apply
  symmetrically".

### Bootstrap rows — 200–208

The `bootstrapping-repo` skill records 9 mutating actions when
running first-time host + per-repo bootstrap. The numbering
follows execution order (host manifest first, per-repo sub-steps
2a → 2c → 2d → 2e → 2f → 2g → 4 → 3). Sub-step 2b (Status field
validation) is read-only and does NOT receive an `action_id`.

| `action_id` | Action | Default class |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 200 | Bootstrap host (manifest write) | A |
| 201 | Bootstrap project step 2a (labels create) | A |
| 202 | Bootstrap project step 2c (config.yml + config.local.yml write) | A |
| 203 | Bootstrap project step 2d (.gitignore append) | A |
| 204 | Bootstrap project step 2e (credentials.yml write) | A |
| 205 | Bootstrap project step 2f (uv sync per-repo venv) | A |
| 206 | Bootstrap project step 2g (audit-init dispatch) | A |
| 207 | Bootstrap project step 4 (routing block injection) | A |
| 208 | Bootstrap project step 3 (state.yml write) | A |

#### Numbering rationale

- 200-range chosen to avoid collision with future Producer
  expansion (1–99 reserved) AND with future Consumer expansion
  (100–199 reserved). The bootstrap namespace is its own block
  because bootstrap actions are neither Producer nor Consumer
  (they run before the role split exists on a fresh repo).
- Rows numbered in execution order so a chronological scan of
  the audit log reads as the linear bootstrap procedure.
- Higher numbers (above the current ceiling of 208) are NOT
  pre-reserved per the SPOT contract — new bootstrap actions
  take the next free integer at the time they are added.

### Team rows ? 300?305

| `action_id` | Action | Default class |
|---:|---|:---:|
| 300 | Handoff Card to another seat | A |
| 301 | Escalate to lead seat (handoff plus separate Blocked transition) | A |
| 302 | Reject or bounce Card to a lower seat | A |
| 303 | Emit agent dispatch instruction | A |
| 304 | Write QA verdict with evidence | A |
| 305 | Refuse illegal handoff or cap breach | A |

The seat-aware class is defined by ADR-0030. Existing actions retain their
identifiers and use `actor_seat` to distinguish the acting seat.

---

## Per-`action_id` payload sub-schemas

Each payload is a JSON object. v1 spec finalizes the shape per
TBD-3. Future fields can be added (additive only); removing or
renaming requires a payload-schema migration (analogous to I-12).

The `payload` column is JSONB / JSON — the database doesn't
enforce shape. Shape is enforced at write-time by the script /
SKILL emitting the entry.

### Producer — `action_id = 1` (Create card)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "title": "Sign in with Google — happy path",
  "labels": ["type:feature", "size:S"],
  "milestone": "v1.0",
  "threads": ["auth"],
  "size": "S",
  "depends_on": [44]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required? | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| `card_number` | integer | yes | Issue number assigned by GitHub |
| `title` | string | yes | The created Issue title |
| `labels` | string list | yes | Applied at creation (may be empty `[]`) |
| `milestone` | string \| null | optional | GitHub Milestone name if any |
| `threads` | string list | optional | Per 0003 § 3.3.1 ThreadRef value object |
| `size` | string `XS\|S\|M\|L` | yes | Mirror of card body Size; for filtering |
| `depends_on` | int list | optional | Card numbers this Card depends on (parsed from Context) |

### Producer — `action_id = 2` (Edit card body)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "before_sha256": "sha256:<64-hex>",
  "after_sha256": "sha256:<64-hex>",
  "sections_changed": ["Acceptance Criteria", "Out of Scope"]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required? | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| `card_number` | integer | yes | |
| `before_sha256` | string | yes | SHA256 of full Card body before edit |
| `after_sha256` | string | yes | SHA256 of full Card body after edit |
| `sections_changed` | string list | yes | Section header names (without leading `## `) the edit touched |

### Producer — `action_id = 3` (Split card)

```json
{
  "source_card": 42,
  "split_into": [50, 51, 52],
  "rationale": "OAuth callback grew to 320 LOC; split into happy/error/sign-out."
}
```

R-class — emits the propose entry (`outcome = escalated`,
`payload.proposal: <text>`) AND the resolve entry (`outcome ∈
{success, failure, rejected}`, `payload.split_into: [...]` populated
on `success`).

### Producer — `action_id = 4` (Update CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md)

R-class. Two entries: propose + resolve.

```json
{
  "files": ["CLAUDE.md", "AGENTS.md"],
  "diff_excerpt": "<short prose summary of the change>",
  "before_block_hashes": {
    "CLAUDE.md": "sha256:<hex>",
    "AGENTS.md": "sha256:<hex>"
  },
  "after_block_hashes": {
    "CLAUDE.md": "sha256:<hex>",
    "AGENTS.md": "sha256:<hex>"
  }
}
```

`before_*` / `after_*` populated only on the resolve entry's
`success` outcome.

### Producer — `action_id = 5` (Backlog → Ready transition)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "from_status": "Backlog",
  "to_status": "Ready",
  "input_completeness_check": "passed"
}
```

`input_completeness_check` is `"passed"` (per ADR-0006 row 5 spec
gate — Producer's input-completeness validation; see I-9).

### Producer — `action_id = 6` (In Progress → Blocked)

R-class. Two entries.

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "from_status": "In Progress",
  "to_status": "Blocked",
  "reason": "<blocker text>",
  "claim_branch": "claim/42-oauth-callback"
}
```

### Producer — `action_id = 7` (Close stale card)

R-class. Two entries.

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "rationale": "<why closing without merge>",
  "last_activity": "2026-04-20T13:00:00Z"
}
```

### Producer — `action_id = 8` (Cancel claim)

R-class. Two entries. Symmetric on Consumer side too (when
Consumer initiates abandonment).

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "branch": "claim/42-oauth-callback",
  "session_slug": "s-a7b3",
  "rationale": "<why canceling>",
  "delete_branch": true,
  "delete_worktree": false
}
```

`delete_worktree: false` is the F-C14 failure-path default
(worktree preserved for human takeover, per ADR-0003).

### Producer — `action_id = 9` (Adjust WIP limit)

```json
{
  "before": 5,
  "after": 7,
  "rationale": "<why changing>"
}
```

### Producer — `action_id = 10` (Modify config.yml)

R-class. Two entries.

```json
{
  "before_sha256": "sha256:<hex>",
  "after_sha256": "sha256:<hex>",
  "fields_changed": ["wip_limit", "autonomy_overrides"]
}
```

`autonomy_overrides:` writes pass through this row.

### Producer — `action_id = 11` (Extend Project fields)

```json
{
  "field_kind": "label",
  "name": "type:experimental",
  "color": "ff5722"
}
```

`field_kind ∈ {label, status_option}` at v1.

### Producer — `action_id = 12` (Auto-merge PR)

R-class for Producer; **N for Consumer** (per I-2 — Consumer
cannot self-merge). On Consumer side: a Consumer attempting this
action is a Hard-floor block (per F-C7) and emits an `action_id =
12` entry with `outcome = failure`, `actor_role = consumer`, plus
`payload.blocked_at_layer = "hard_floor"`.

```json
{
  "pr_number": 123,
  "card_number": 42,
  "merge_method": "squash",
  "blocked_at_layer": null
}
```

### Producer — `action_id = 13` (Dispatch Consumer)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "mode": "Mode-1",
  "consumer_session_id": "<UUID-shape>",
  "dispatch_concurrency": 1,
  "wake_up": false
}
```

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `mode` | `"Mode-1"` (architect-spawned) or `"Mode-2"` (Producer-spawned subagent) |
| `consumer_session_id` | The new ConsumerProcess's session id, if observable at dispatch time |
| `dispatch_concurrency` | The current concurrency cap (per C-PLUGIN-3) |
| `wake_up` | `true` when this is a Mode-2 wake-up of a previously-suspended Consumer; `false` for fresh dispatch |

### Producer — `action_id = 14` (Auto-trigger retro / weekly report)

```json
{
  "trigger_kind": "retro",
  "trigger_reason": "milestone_close",
  "lookback_window_days": 7,
  "report_destination": "card_thread"
}
```

`trigger_kind ∈ {retro, weekly_report}`. `trigger_reason ∈
{milestone_close, n_cards_completed, decomposition_drift,
cadence_due}`.

### Consumer — `action_id = 100` (Claim card)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "branch": "claim/42-oauth-callback",
  "worktree": "/home/.../worktrees/proj/claim/42-oauth-callback",
  "session_slug": "s-a7b3",
  "base_branch": "main"
}
```

> Note: `worktree:` IS present here (this is the audit log, not the
> on-origin ClaimMarker). The audit DB is private to the architect
> (per ADR-0006 §5 "not public"); the info-leak guard applies only
> to artifacts on origin (see [`05-github-artifact-schemas.md`](./05-github-artifact-schemas.md)).

### Consumer — `action_id = 101` (Surface — F-C8)

R-class. Two entries (propose + resolve).

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "trigger": "design_decision_point",
  "summary": "<one-line description of what needs architect input>",
  "channel": "card_thread_comment"
}
```

`trigger` enum (open-ended): `spec_insufficient`,
`design_decision_point`, `debug_stuck`, `cross_card_touch`,
`acceptance_criteria_unreachable`, `other`.

`channel` is always `"card_thread_comment"` at v1 (the primary
channel under both Modes per C-PLUGIN-1 workaround a). Mode-2
optional `SendMessage` is not load-bearing and not audited
separately.

### Consumer — `action_id = 102` (Terminate — success path)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "branch": "claim/42-oauth-callback",
  "pr_number": 123,
  "worktree_removed": true,
  "retro_supplemented": true
}
```

### Consumer — `action_id = 103` (Terminate — failure path)

R-class. Two entries.

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "branch": "claim/42-oauth-callback",
  "blocked_reason": "<failure context>",
  "claim_released": true,
  "worktree_kept": true,
  "worktree_path": "/home/.../worktrees/proj/claim/42-oauth-callback"
}
```

### Consumer — `action_id = 104` (Retro Notes write)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "pr_number": 123,
  "phase": "initial",
  "lesson_summary": "<one-line summary of what landed in Retro Notes>"
}
```

`phase ∈ {initial, post_merge_supplement}` — the two-pass
authorship rule (§1.8.3).

### Consumer — `action_id = 105` (Review-cycle response — direct one-line fix)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "pr_number": 123,
  "cycle_index": 2,
  "comment_id_replied": 1234567890,
  "diff_lines_changed": 1,
  "commit_sha": "abc1234"
}
```

The architect's review comment was actionable as a literal
one-line edit; no skill orchestration involved.

### Consumer — `action_id = 106` (Review-cycle response — re-delegation)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "pr_number": 123,
  "cycle_index": 2,
  "delegated_to_skill": "superpowers:subagent-driven-development",
  "delegation_brief": "<one-line summary of what was handed off>",
  "commits_pushed": 3
}
```

The change was substantive enough to hand back to a TDD-driven
sub-agent rather than fix in line.

### Consumer — `action_id = 107` (Review-cycle response — verification chain)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "pr_number": 123,
  "cycle_index": 2,
  "skills_invoked": [
    "superpowers:verification-before-completion",
    "superpowers:requesting-code-review"
  ],
  "verification_outcome": "passed"
}
```

Standard pre-resubmit verification chain (F-C9 / F-C10).
`verification_outcome ∈ {passed, regressed, blocked}`.

### Consumer — `action_id = 108` (Review-cycle response — cross-platform review)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "pr_number": 123,
  "cycle_index": 2,
  "skill_invoked": "gstack:/codex",
  "findings_count": 2,
  "findings_addressed": 2
}
```

Per F-C11 cross-platform adversarial review.

### Consumer — `action_id = 109` (Review-cycle response — QA pass)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "pr_number": 123,
  "cycle_index": 2,
  "skill_invoked": "gstack:/qa",
  "qa_url": "https://staging.example.com/feature/...",
  "qa_outcome": "passed"
}
```

Mandatory for any UI-touching card per AGENTS.md routing block.
`qa_outcome ∈ {passed, failed, blocked}`.

### Consumer — `action_id = 110` (Review-cycle response — security audit)

```json

```

OWASP / STRIDE audit. Triggered when the diff touches auth,
input handling, dependency lists, or secrets.

### Consumer — `action_id = 111` (Review-cycle response — cycle completion)

```json
{
  "card_number": 42,
  "pr_number": 123,
  "cycle_index": 2,
  "sub_actions_in_cycle": [105, 107, 109],
  "comments_replied": 3,
  "commits_pushed": 1,
  "ready_for_re_review": true
}
```

Final cycle entry — Consumer summarizes what changed across
`sub_actions_in_cycle` and signals the architect that the PR is
ready for the next review pass.

### Numbering rationale for the 105–111 split

The earlier draft bundled all seven sub-actions under a single
`action_id = 105` with a `subaction` JSONB field. The split
into per-sub-action `action_id`s was made to make horizontal
retro queries cheap:

- "Last week's QA passes": `WHERE action_id = 109`
- "Re-delegations this month per Consumer":
  `SELECT session_id, COUNT(*) FROM audit_log WHERE action_id = 106 GROUP BY session_id`
- "Cycles per card": `SELECT card_number, COUNT(*) FROM audit_log WHERE action_id = 111 GROUP BY card_number`

These would have required `payload->'subaction' = '...'` JSON
path queries (one-order-of-magnitude slower) under the bundled
shape. Vertical queries (cycle history per Card) are unaffected
by the split — both shapes filter on `card_number` first.

## AuditTrail scope — per-Project (TBD-5 finalized)

**Decision:** AuditTrail is **per-Project**. The `project` column
is the partitioning axis; one row → one Project.

**DB-physical cardinality is orthogonal.** One BYO RDBMS connection
MAY serve multiple Projects (architect shares an `audit_db_url`
across several `<repo>/.board-superpowers/config.yml` files), or
each Project MAY get its own DB. Both work because every query
carries `WHERE project = ?` regardless. The architect's
`audit_db_url` choice does not affect the logical scope decision.

### Why per-Project (not global, per-architect, per-Card, or per-host)

1. **Multi-architect symmetry on a single Project (I-3).** Two
   architects on the same Project converge to one logical
   AuditTrail; cross-architect timeline reconstruction is one query.
2. **Practical query scoping.** Daily / retro / F-13 weekly routines
   all use `WHERE project = ? AND timestamp > ?` as the dominant
   index path.

Rejected alternatives: per-architect (violates I-3); per-Card
(over-fragmentation, N joins for cross-card timeline); per-host
(splits one architect's two-machine workflow).

### Cited rationale

- 0003 § 3.3.10 TBD-5 — finalization here.
- I-3 (multi-architect symmetry).
- ADR-0006 §5 (BYO RDBMS — schema applies regardless of scope
  decision).

---

## DDL ownership — one-shot init script (shipped in v0.3.0 / #34)

**Decision:** board-superpowers ships a one-shot
`scripts/audit-init.sh` that runs idempotent DDL the first time
`BOARD_SP_AUDIT_DB_URL` (or `~/.board-superpowers/credentials.yml`)
resolves successfully. Architect controls the DB; plugin owns the
schema.

### Script contract

`scripts/audit-init.sh` reads credentials, validates the scheme,
dispatches DDL by dialect, and verifies the sentinel row.

| Step | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| 1 | `bsp_ensure_venv <repo_root>` — uv missing OR uv sync fail → exit 1 |
| 2 | Read credentials from `BOARD_SP_AUDIT_DB_URL` env var or `~/.board-superpowers/credentials.yml:audit_db_url` (env-var precedence) |
| 3 | Parse URL + validate against the **6-scheme allowlist** (`postgres` / `postgresql` / `mysql` / `mysql+pymysql` / `sqlite` / `sqlite3` per ADR-0009) |
| 4 | Dispatch DDL apply by scheme — sqlite (stdlib `sqlite3` executescript on `audit-schema.sqlite.sql`) / postgres (subprocess `psql -f audit-schema.postgres.sql`) / mysql (venv-python `pymysql` executescript on `audit-schema.mysql.sql`) |
| 5 | Verify `audit_schema_meta.version=1` row exists; insert sentinel via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` |

### Idempotency

DDL uses `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses so re-runs are safe. Indices
similarly. The schema-version sentinel is upserted (`INSERT ... ON
CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for postgres / sqlite; `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`
for mysql); re-runs safe.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | DDL applied (or schema already at current version — no-op) |
| `1` | DB unreachable / DDL failed / credentials malformed / `bsp_ensure_venv` returned non-zero |
| `2` | Bad arguments |
| `3` | `psql` / `mysql` client unavailable on PATH (sqlite scheme uses stdlib so this code never fires for sqlite) |

### Why one-shot, not embedded

- Per P7 (D-META-1): we ship mechanism, not configuration. The
  architect explicitly opts in to schema creation by running the
  script.
- Per ADR-0006 §5 trade-off acknowledgment: BYO RDBMS adds
  onboarding friction; making it explicit (run a script) is the
  feature, not a bug.
- Embedding DDL into `bootstrap-project.sh` would couple per-repo
  setup to host-level audit configuration — orthogonal concerns.

### Cited rationale

- P7 / D-META-1 (mechanism, not configuration).
- ADR-0006 §5 (BYO RDBMS).
- ADR-0009 (6-scheme allowlist).

## jsonl fallback row schema

When audit-log-write.sh degrades to jsonl (instead of writing to the
configured RDBMS), each JSON line has the following top-level fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `ts` | string (ISO 8601 UTC) | Wall-clock time the entry was written |
| `repo_root` | string | Absolute path of the repository root |
| `session_id` | string | Session identifier from `bsp_resolve_session_id`; parallels the SQLite path's `session_id` column. Present from v0.4.x onward (chunk 15 fix). Legacy rows written before this fix lack the field — readers must handle its absence. |
| `actor_seat` | string | Optional seat; omitted on legacy rows |
| `action_id` | string | Matrix row id (same values as RDBMS `action_id`) |
| `decision_class` | string | `A`, `R`, or `N` (per ADR-0006 D-AUTONOMY-1) |
| `skill` | string | Originating skill name |
| `summary` | string | Human-readable summary including `approval=`, `outcome=`, and `payload=` tokens |
| `mode` | string | Degradation cause (see "jsonl fallback mode-field" below) |

SPOT: only `bsp_audit_local_write` in `scripts/lib/common.sh` writes
jsonl rows; SKILL bodies and other callers do not duplicate this schema.

## jsonl fallback mode-field

The entry's `mode` field identifies the degradation cause. SPOT: only
`bsp_audit_local_write` in `scripts/lib/common.sh` writes this field;
SKILL bodies and other callers do not duplicate.

### Legacy values (read-back compatibility only)

| Value | Origin |
|-------|--------|
| `v1-minimum-degraded` | Written by board-superpowers v0.2.x (before audit governance shipped). Readers MUST handle this for forward-compat; writers MUST NOT emit new entries with this value. |

### Current write enum (v0.3.0 onward)

| Value | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `no-db` | Architect picked "skip" at bootstrap step 2e; audit_db_url unset by design |
| `degraded-db-unavailable` | audit_db_url set but DB rejected connection (network / auth / DDL not applied) |
| `degraded-uv-missing` | host doesn't have uv installed (architect must run bootstrap-host.sh) |
| `degraded-venv-create-failed` | uv installed but `uv sync` failed (network / proxy / lock conflict / disk full) |
| `contract-violation` | Caller passed non-integer `action_id`; `audit-log-write.sh` rejects pre-DB-branch (#43 AC2) and writes the offending row to jsonl for post-mortem |
| `bootstrap-pending` | Bootstrap-time outbox row awaiting flush — written while bootstrap is still in flight (DB / venv may not yet be ready). Auto-flushed by the bootstrap end fast-path / opportunistic guard / SessionStart observer prompt |
| `audit-dead-letter` | `bootstrap-pending` row exhausted retry budget (`retry_count ≥ 5`) OR exceeded TTL (`pending_since > 24h`); SessionStart hook surfaces row count via dep-alert for manual investigation |

`bsp_audit_local_write` (in `scripts/lib/common.sh`) enforces this
enum as an explicit allowlist plus the legacy `v1-minimum-degraded`
value; unknown modes are rejected with `return 2` before any
side effects.

### Cited rationale

- ADR-0006 §5 "Trade-off explicitly registered" + ADR-0009.
- Card #34 design doc § 4.4 (5-tier mode enum) + § 7.1 (this section as same-PR add).

## Migration model — schema_version + lazy-on-read

When the audit-log schema needs to evolve (e.g., adding a column,
splitting `payload` further), reuse the I-12 pattern from
[`03-config-schemas.md`](./03-config-schemas.md):

| Mechanism | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `audit_schema_meta` row tracking | `version: <int>` sentinel; updated by migration scripts |
| Migration scripts | `scripts/migrations/audit-v<N>-to-v<N+1>.sh` — one per source version; runs DDL + (if needed) data backfill; idempotent |
| Trigger | Lazy-on-read — when a session opens the audit DB and detects `audit_schema_meta.version < <plugin-known-max>`, the migration runs before any write |
| Older plugin reading newer schema | **Fail loudly.** Plugin refuses to write entries; surfaces "this audit DB is on schema v<X>; you're on plugin v<Y>; please upgrade" |
| Migration shape | Versioned-and-additive. Add columns. Never drop / rename. |

### Cited rationale

- I-12 (canonical pattern).
- §1.5.5 TBD-Notes (migration runner timing).
- 0003 § 3.3.8 TBD-4.

## DB-unavailable degradation

Per ADR-0006 §5 "Trade-off explicitly registered" + 0003 § 3.3.8
"DB-unavailable degradation rule":

If the audit DB is unreachable (network, credentials, DDL not
applied), **every A-class action degrades to R-class** (architect
prompted for everything Producer would otherwise auto-do). This
is the fallback that keeps the plugin usable when the DB is down;
the autonomy gain that A buys is lost while degraded.

The degradation is per-action, in-flight, surfaced via the
preflight piggyback: "audit DB unreachable; auto-actions paused
until restored. Approve dispatch of Card #42?"

### Cited rationale

- ADR-0006 §5.
- 0003 § 3.3.8.
