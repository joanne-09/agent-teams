# ADR — architecture decision records

ADRs capture decisions that shaped board-superpowers and would be
expensive or contentious to revisit. Each is immutable once
accepted; superseding one creates a new ADR that links to the old.

## Numbering

Four-digit, monotonic, no gaps. Reuse a number only if the previous
ADR was rejected before being accepted (no live readers).

## Statuses

- `proposed` — draft, open for feedback
- `accepted` — merged, in force
- `superseded by ADR-<N>` — kept for history; new ADR points back
- `rejected` — never landed; kept so future readers don't re-litigate
- `stub` — file exists, content not yet written (used during the
  initial skeleton phase only)

## Template

```markdown
# ADR <N>: <Title>

**Status:** proposed | accepted | superseded by ADR-<N> | rejected
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders:** <names / roles>

## Context

What forces (technical, organizational, product) made this decision
necessary? What were we observing before?

## Decision

The choice we made, stated as a positive present-tense claim.

## Consequences

What changed because of this choice — good and bad. What new
constraints does it impose. What's now possible that wasn't.

## Alternatives considered

What else we evaluated and why each lost. One paragraph each.

## Notes                          <!-- OPTIONAL -->

Precedent clarifications, exceptions, or attribution that don't fit
elsewhere. Examples:
- Why this ADR's number reuses one previously occupied by a stub
  (immutability exception)
- Why this ADR ships before its full implementation lands (canonical
  source vs as-of-date artifact)

Omit if no such notes apply.
