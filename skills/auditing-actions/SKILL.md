description: |
  Use right after `board-superpowers:classifying-actions` returns a
  decision, every time a board-superpowers skill is recording what it
  is about to do or what it just did. For actions that proceed
  automatically, apply once after the action lands. For actions that
  wait for architect approval, apply once when first proposing the
  action and again after the architect approves or declines. Apply
  even when the action seems too small to log — every mutating action
  gets a row, no exceptions. Do NOT use for read-only actions; reads
  are not audited. Do NOT invoke to determine the A/R/N decision —
  that is `board-superpowers:classifying-actions`.

# auditing-actions

This skill is the audit-row writing authority. Every mutating action
the plugin performs leaves a trail of one or two rows in the audit log,
recording what was decided, who approved (if anyone), and what
happened when the action ran.

## How to apply this skill

The caller has just received an A/R decision from
`board-superpowers:classifying-actions`. Now the caller invokes
`scripts/audit-log-write.sh` (located inside the board-superpowers
plugin) once for A-class actions or twice for R-class actions, with
structured args. Examples below assume the caller has resolved the
plugin root path; `scripts/lib/common.sh` ships a `bsp_plugin_root`
helper that does this cross-platform.

For A-class actions:

```bash
bash <plugin-root>/scripts/audit-log-write.sh \
  --action-id <int> \
  --decision A \
  --skill <calling-skill-name> \
  --actor-seat <analyst|architect|rd|qa|em|human> \
  --approval-stage auto \
  --outcome <success|failure> \
  --payload '<json-per-action_id>'
```

For R-class actions, two invocations — propose, then resolve:

```bash
# Step 1: propose entry (before architect ack)
bash <plugin-root>/scripts/audit-log-write.sh \
  --action-id <int> --decision R --skill <name> --actor-seat <seat> \
  --approval-stage propose --outcome success \
  --payload '<proposal-json>'

# Step 2: resolve entry (after architect approves OR declines)
bash <plugin-root>/scripts/audit-log-write.sh \
  --action-id <int> --decision R --skill <name> --actor-seat <seat> \
  --approval-stage approved \         # OR rejected
  --outcome <success|failure> \       # OR success (for rejected)
  --payload '<full-action-json>'      # OR '<decline-reason-json>'
```

`--actor-seat` is optional for backward compatibility; omit it only when no seat is bound. The script writes SQL NULL for legacy rows.

The script returns exit 0 when the row was written somewhere — to the
configured RDBMS (preferred) or to a host-local jsonl file (fallback).
The caller does NOT need to handle DB errors specially; the script
self-heals (recreating the venv if needed) and degrades gracefully.

## Quick reference

| What you have | What you need |
|---------------|---------------|
| an action just decided as A | invoke once with approval-stage=auto |
| an action just decided as R, before ack | invoke once with approval-stage=propose |
| architect approved an R-class proposal | invoke once with approval-stage=approved |
| architect declined an R-class proposal | invoke once with approval-stage=rejected |
| audit row schema details | read `references/schema.md` |
| per-action_id payload templates | read `references/db-write-conventions.md` |
| degradation behavior | read `references/degradation-mode.md` |

## What this skill does NOT cover

- **Deciding A vs R vs N** — that's `board-superpowers:classifying-actions`.
  This skill records what was decided.
- **Drafting the proposal text** — that's the molecular caller's UX
  responsibility. This skill writes the text into the `payload` field.
- **Surfacing degraded-mode warnings to the architect** — the script
  emits stderr WARN; architect may notice. This skill doesn't escalate.

This skill defines **how to record an action's audit trail**. The
caller decides what to do; this records it.
