## Why this exists

The AI-era architect's primary value is **no longer writing code**. It is sequencing problems, designing architecture, judging tradeoffs, and verifying that what the AI built actually works. Coding itself is becoming AI's job.

board-superpowers operationalizes that role-shift. Concretely:

- You run **N parallel Consumer sessions** against **one Manager session**.
- You walk away.
- You come back to a **merge-ready queue of PRs**, each carrying an explicit `## Human Verification TODO` checklist.
- **Verifying that checklist is your remaining job** — and the plugin's whole shape is designed to maximize how far that scarce attention can go.

If you have personally decided to focus on judgment and architecture rather than line-by-line authorship, and you are willing to dispatch implementation to AI without babysitting it — this plugin is for you.

## What changes for you

| Without board-superpowers | With board-superpowers |
|---|---|
| One terminal, babysit one session, rebase constantly | N terminals, each a dedicated Consumer you mostly do not read |
| "What should I work on?" lives in your head | A Manager session reads the board and tells you |
| Sprint planning is a lossy conversation | Decomposition is a skill that enforces INVEST and vertical slicing |
| Scope creep caught mid-PR | Scope is frozen into the card body before any Consumer claims it |
| Merges are surprises | Every PR ships with a structured `## Human Verification TODO` |
| Your coordination state is in your head | Your coordination state is your **own** GitHub Project — we never own it |

## The three pillars

board-superpowers sits at the intersection of three commitments. Most adjacent tools cover one or two; covering all three is the differentiation.

### 1. Substrate commitment — your board, never ours

Truth lives on **your existing board** (GitHub Project today; Linear, Jira, others via the `BoardAdapter` contract tomorrow). We never own a hosted control plane, never run a backend, never ask you to log into our service.

If a feature ever requires durable state that lives anywhere except your board + your git remote, we have broken the commitment. This is structural, not aspirational — it is what makes us the open-source choice next to Devin / Factory / similar hosted products that *must* own their state for business reasons.

### 2. Methodology embedded as code

The agile discipline is **enforced by the plugin**, not configured by you:

- **INVEST** every card. Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.
- **Vertical slices** over layer-splits. Always.
- **Pull-based work**: Consumers claim atomically; Managers do not assign.
- **One PR per session**. No multi-card sessions.
- **Lightweight retro** — aggregated from PR notes, not a separate ceremony.
- **Soft WIP limit** (default 5) — warn, do not block.
- **Cards are XS / S / M / L** — never story points, never velocity, never per-architect KPIs.

Anything that smells like sprint-cadence-cosplay (story-point estimation, velocity tracking, retro-as-meeting) is deliberately absent. AI orchestration inverts which resources are scarce, and most ceremonies that human teams need are noise here.

### 3. Composition is permanent

board-superpowers **never reimplements TDD, QA, code review, brainstorming, or security audit**. Those belong to `superpowers` and `gstack`. board-superpowers is the **scheduling layer** that composes them into routines:

- Manager's intake routine routes through `gstack:/office-hours` and `superpowers:brainstorming`.
- Consumer's implementation routine delegates to `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`.
- Consumer's pre-PR verification chain calls `superpowers:verification-before-completion` → `superpowers:requesting-code-review` → `gstack:/review` → `gstack:/codex` (cross-platform adversarial review) → `gstack:/qa` (UI cards) → `gstack:/cso` (security-flagged cards).

If a similar discipline already exists in those upstream plugins, we use it. If we ever ship a duplicate, that is a bug.

## The two roles

Every session plays exactly one role with respect to the kanban. Routing happens automatically based on your first message.

### Producer — keep-the-board-healthy session

> Today's only Producer-class role: **Manager**.

A Manager session is **long-lived, aggregate-view, never writes code**. It exposes 15 capabilities across five clusters:

- **Read primitives** — atomic kanban query, pending-PR queue with priority ordering, blocked-session inspection, today's dispatch recommendation, board-health snapshot, context briefing on switch-back.
- **Action features** — overnight batch dispatch ("the human rests; the agents do not"), interactive intake & design routing, decomposition into INVEST-compliant cards, triage with a 5-step remediation ladder.
- **Cadence features** — lazy stale-session detection, event-driven retro routine (no sprint cadence), weekly aggregated report.
- **Project-level conversations** — quality-harness setup conversation (your project's golden principles encoded as lint + structural tests + auto-PR), kanban hygiene & maintenance.

### Consumer — one-card-to-done session

> Today's only Consumer-class role: **Implementer**.

A Consumer session **claims one Ready card atomically**, fetches its spec, delegates implementation through skills, runs adversarial self-review, opens a PR, handles the review cycle, terminates cleanly.

Two operational modes:

- **Mode-1** (architect-spawned): you paste a kick-off prompt into a fresh terminal — works on Claude Code AND Codex CLI.
- **Mode-2** (Producer-spawned): the Manager spawns a Consumer as a subagent — Claude Code only at v1.

Each Consumer runs in its own git worktree. N parallel Consumers therefore never share HEAD.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

board-superpowers refuses to run if these are missing — by design:

```bash
# superpowers — TDD, subagent-driven development, code review
/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official

# gstack — design, QA, visual review, security
cd ~/.claude/skills && git clone https://github.com/garrytan/gstack && cd gstack && ./setup
```

You will also need: `gh` CLI (logged in, with `project` scope), `git`, `python3`.

### Install board-superpowers

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PanQiWei/board-superpowers ~/.claude/plugins/board-superpowers
```

#### Claude Code

```
/plugin add local ~/.claude/plugins/board-superpowers
```

CC auto-discovers the plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` at install time — no extra step needed.

#### Codex CLI

Codex CLI doesn't auto-discover plugin-bundled hooks (the plugin manifest spec has no `hooks` field). Register the SessionStart hook once after install:

```bash
# Inspect the registration snippet first (recommended):
bash ~/.claude/plugins/board-superpowers/scripts/register-codex-hooks.sh

# Then auto-merge into your user-scope ~/.codex/hooks.json:
bash ~/.claude/plugins/board-superpowers/scripts/register-codex-hooks.sh --install-user

# OR per-repo (writes ./.codex/hooks.json; requires repo trust):
bash ~/.claude/plugins/board-superpowers/scripts/register-codex-hooks.sh --install-repo
```

The script is idempotent — re-running replaces the existing entry rather than duplicating. It backs up your `hooks.json` before overwriting. Uninstall via `--uninstall-user`.

### One-time per-repo bootstrap

For each repo where you want board-superpowers active. Currently manual — an auto-bootstrap skill is planned for a future version.

1. **In GitHub UI**, create a Project v2 with a `Status` single-select field whose options are exactly, in this order: `Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Blocked → In Review → Done`.
2. **Add the standard labels** by running:
   ```bash
   bash ~/.claude/plugins/board-superpowers/scripts/setup-labels.sh
   ```
   This creates `wip-override`, `suspended`, `security`, `pr-contract-override` (idempotent — skips already-existing labels).
3. **Create `.board-superpowers/config.yml`** in the repo root and commit it:
   ```yaml
   project: <owner>/<number>      # e.g., PanQiWei/4
   ```
   Then create `.board-superpowers/config.local.yml` (gitignored, per-user):
   ```yaml
   wip_limit: 5                   # personal capacity; soft cap, default 5
   ```
4. **Verify** by running:
   ```bash
   bash ~/.claude/plugins/board-superpowers/scripts/check-deps.sh
   bash ~/.claude/plugins/board-superpowers/scripts/read-board.sh \
     --owner <owner> --project <number> --status Ready
   ```
   Both should exit 0; the second prints the JSON list of Ready cards (empty `[]` is fine).
5. **Optional — add a routing block** to your `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` so the agent knows to invoke this plugin's skills explicitly. The entry skill (`using-board-superpowers`) will trigger on common phrases without it, but the explicit routing improves reliability. See `~/.claude/plugins/board-superpowers/AGENTS.md` § "board-superpowers session routing" for a copy-pasteable block.

That is it. After step 5 (or step 4 if you skip the routing block), open a fresh CC session in your repo and type "what should I work on" to confirm the entry skill triggers.

### Role-aware Producer phrases

| You say | Manager does |
|---|---|
| `what should I work on?` / `morning briefing` | Daily routine — board snapshot + dispatch recommendation |
| `I have a new requirement: <X>` | Intake — routes you through design skills, then decomposition |
| `[role:em] dispatch the team` | EM dispatch — ranks legal Role lanes and renders carrier-neutral kickoff prompts |
| `[role:analyst] I have a new requirement: <X>` | Analyst intake — shapes a Backlog Card and hands it to architect |
| `[role:architect] author the spec for card #N` | Architect delivery — claims a docs-only Card, opens a spec PR, then hands implementation slices to RD |
| `weekly retro` | Retro — aggregates last 7 days of PR notes into a structured report |

Role tokens are durable routing hints; the Card Role field remains the ownership source of truth. The v0.8.0 producer slice does not yet ship the QA-owned `verifying-delivery` routine.md`.

### Dispatching a Consumer

When the Manager hands you a kick-off prompt like:

```
[role:rd] [board-card:#42] Work on card #42 in project acme/3.

Start by invoking `consuming-card` skill. It will handle the full
lifecycle: claim (atomic) -> implement -> PR -> update board.

Context the architect added on top of the card body:
None — card body is complete.
```

Open a fresh terminal in the project directory, paste it, and walk away. The Consumer reports back only when its PR is open (or when it hits a real blocker that needs you).

## The PR contract

Every Consumer PR ships with three structured sections:

- **`## Automated Verification`** (required) — what tests / lints / cross-platform reviews / security passes ran, and what passed. The audit trail of the verification chain.
- **`## Human Verification TODO`** (optional for low-risk cards; required when end-to-end human checks are needed) — the steps the AI could not automate. **This is your remaining job.** Source: Producer's plan + Consumer's implementation-time additions.
- **`## Retro Notes`** (required when reusable lessons exist) — knowledge harvesting for future cards. **Not** estimate-vs-actual, **not** velocity, **not** KPI metrics.

If a PR is missing one of these (when required), Manager's Review Queue routine flags the violation inline. The structure is protocol; the *content* is project-specific and never preset.

## What we explicitly do NOT do

These are commitments to *not* do things. Future feature requests of the shape "should we add X?" should test against this list.

- **No backend, database, or web UI.** Truth lives on your board.
- **No reimplementation of upstream disciplines.** TDD belongs to `superpowers`; QA / review / brainstorming / security belong to `gstack`.
- **No CI replacement.** Tests run wherever your CI runs.
- **No story points / velocity / per-architect performance metrics.** Cards are XS / S / M / L. Retro surfaces flow signals, not KPIs.
- **No agent self-merging PRs.** Humans merge. Agents propose.
- **No hosted install service / account creation / install wizard.** Distribution is `git clone` + `/plugin add local` today, marketplace one-liner tomorrow. Never a hosted layer.
- **No methodology-extension marketplace.** Third-party "discipline plugins" extending routines are permanently out — versioning debt and chicken-and-egg costs do not fit the project framing.
- **No cross-team / fleet view at v1.** That is the explicit 10x (see Vision below), not v1.

## Why there's no sprint, no sub-issue, no story points

Most agile process artifacts assume a fixed implementation throughput — roughly: human-developer-days. When that assumption holds, time-boxing (sprint), per-day decomposition (sub-task / sub-issue), and scale-aware estimation (story points) all earn their keep.

In AI-orchestrated software development, implementation throughput moves 10×–100×; **architect attention does not**. The agile process surface that humans built around the implementation bottleneck loses its load-bearing purpose and quietly becomes ceremony.

board-superpowers walked through this surface concept by concept. Each removed artifact was tested against one question: *what does this do that something else doesn't already do better in an AI-cadence world?*

### Sprint — gone

Time-boxing assumed throughput was fixed; you committed a batch and demoed at the boundary. With cards landing in hours, not days, the commit-batch-demo-retro cycle has nothing to time-box. Replaced by:

- **Continuous flow** — cards land when ready.
- **Per-PR demo** — every PR carries a Human Verification TODO; the architect verifies, which IS the demo.
- **Retro from PR Notes** — signal aggregation, not ceremony.

### Sub-issue / sub-task — degenerate

Sub-issue had six historical purposes in human-cadence agile:

1. Decompose features into person-day chunks (decomposition).
2. Coordinate work across multiple humans (coordination).
3. Show stakeholders feature-level progress (visibility).
4. Aggregate per-task estimates into feature-level numbers (estimation aggregation).
5. Order sub-tasks within a sprint (sequencing).
6. Help the human brain navigate complex work (chunking).

In AI-cadence software R&D, four die outright:

- **(1) Decomposition** is replaced by **INVEST sibling slicing** plus `depends-on` dependency edges. Cards are already hours-scale; there's no atomic unit underneath them that's still meaningful.
- **(2) Coordination** is replaced by the **atomic claim primitive** — N parallel Consumer sessions race at the git-push layer; whoever wins owns the card. No coordinating "parent" needed.
- **(4) Estimation aggregation** loses meaning when sizing is XS/S/M/L and the absolute scale is hours.
- **(5) Sprint-internal sequencing** disappears when sprint disappears.

The remaining two — **(3) stakeholder visibility** and **(6) mental chunking** — shift one level up. The architect now reasons in terms of **Thread** (named work mainline) and **Milestone** (deliverable bucket), not feature-vs-sub-task. Both already exist in board-superpowers' work hierarchy.

So: a parent card with N sub-cards underneath would buy nothing that Thread + sibling Cards + dependencies don't already provide, while costing protocol purity. Parent cards would be non-claimable, would violate the *one Card = one Consumer session = one PR* invariant, and would introduce a status-derivation rule that doesn't even agree across backends (GitHub, Linear, Jira each have different rules for whether parent state auto-updates from children).

We honor backend-native sub-issues that users have created in GitHub / Linear / Jira — they appear as display-only metadata on the protocol-flat Card. We just don't elevate them to protocol semantic.

### Story points — gone

Story points were calibrated to sprint commitment ("how much can the team finish in two weeks"). With sprint gone and cards in hours, the calibrated unit is gone. We use **XS / S / M / L** for rough sizing — coarse enough to be quick, granular enough to flag *this card is too big, slice further*.

### Burndown chart, stand-up, epic — also gone or transformed

- **Burndown chart** visualizes sprint progress; without sprint, the daily routine reads WIP + Done counts directly.
- **Stand-up** is human-team synchronization; agents don't need to sync, and the architect already reads PRs.
- **Epic** is replaced by **Thread** (theme grouping) or **Milestone** (deliverable bucket) — same role, more agile-orthodox vocabulary, no multi-sprint container assumption.

### The pattern in one sentence

> If a software-development concept assumes implementation throughput is the bottleneck, AI-native R&D probably makes it degenerate. **Architect attention is the new bottleneck**; everything we kept and everything we built optimizes for that.

Spec-level rationale: [`docs/architecture/0001-positioning.md`](./docs/architecture/0001-positioning.md) (premises P1, P2b, P3) and [`docs/architecture/adr/0025-kanban-protocol-as-top-contract.md`](./docs/architecture/adr/0025-kanban-protocol-as-top-contract.md) (the protocol-shape decision that lets the projection layer absorb backend native sub-issues without elevating them).

## Two design principles you should know about

### Meta-methodology, not opinionated configuration

board-superpowers ships **mechanisms**: the conversational scaffolds and maintenance routines you use to *establish and evolve* your own practice. It deliberately ships **no project-specific defaults**:

- No default lint rules. Manager helps you bootstrap your own.
- No default PR-section content. The 3-section *structure* is protocol; the *content* is yours.
- No fixed WIP number. A starting default exists; Manager assists you tuning it from observed flow metrics.
- No default retro template. Retro aggregates *your* signals, not ours.

If we ever shipped a default whose content prejudges what your project should look like, that principle is broken.

### Default + override + accountability

Every governance dimension follows one shape: a sane **default** executes automatically; **overrides** are allowed but cost explicit friction (a config edit, a written justification, an architect prompt); every override leaves an **accountable trace** (audit-log row, PR description, card thread comment).

The Producer's autonomy matrix has 14 rows mapping every action to one of: **A** (auto, audit-logged), **R** (propose-then-await-approval), or **N** (permanently rejected). You can always see what the AI did, why, and whether you approved.

## Vision

Two amplifiers of the v1 thesis. Both are explicitly post-v1; both are first-class on the roadmap.

### Self-improving methodology (per project)

Retro signals auto-tune your project's CLAUDE.md decomposition rules. Year 2 of using board-superpowers on a project, the agent knows your repo's idioms — which subsystems get under-sized, which areas need a11y verification on every PR, which dependencies always surprise — better than a new hire would in 6 months. The methodology stays the same; the parameters tune themselves.

### Cross-team standard

Multi-architect, multi-board, fleet view. The methodology becomes the lingua franca for AI-era engineering teams the way Scrum was for the prior era — but enforced by code, not by ceremony. The `BoardAdapter` contract is what makes this reachable for non-GitHub teams.

### Explicitly rejected

Open methodology marketplace (third-party "discipline plugins"). The versioning debt of a stable plugin contract is heavy; chicken-and-egg ecosystem risk is real; it does not fit the project framing.

## Status

v1 design is being finalized. Implementation is dogfooded against the plugin's own GitHub Project — every non-trivial change passes through a Manager-Consumer flow.

- Architecture spec: `docs/architecture/` (read `0001-positioning.md` first)
